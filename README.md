# Digit Recognition using TensorFlow

## Prerequisites:
1. Python installation (64 bit, version 3.6.x)
2. Tensorflow (install using the pip3 or anaconda python package manager)

## Idea:
<b>Release 1: </b>Implementing a digit recognition with TensorFlow. Using the training/testing dataset MNIST with 28 by 28 pixel images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9, each with the corresponding label. <br/>
<b>Release 2: </b>Extend the basic implemenation with some fancy neural network stuff, like recurrency or anything else. This Release will be specified soon...
